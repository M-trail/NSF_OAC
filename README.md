In the Zip file WLSM-New.zip, we conduct codes reproduce the weighted least square method presented in "On the fundamental diagram for freeway traffic: A novel calibration approach for single-regime models.", which helps us to calibrate empirical/physics fundamental diagram models so that those calibrated models can be used as the prior.
